We’ll rebuild in this order and you’ll test after each step.

Step 1 — Page + layout only (no game)
Build layout, controls panel, canvas sizing, HUD only.
Goal: confirm layout sizing and UI works.
Test: page loads, buttons visible, canvas size correct.

Step 2 — Core data models (no render loop)
Add Player class and roster data only.
No motion or draw yet.
Test: console logs show roster initialized.

Step 3 — Render loop (static field + players)
Draw field lines, endzones, and static players.
No movement or input yet.
Test: players appear in correct spots.

Step 4 — Input paths (route drawing)
Add mouse/touch input and route line drawing.
No movement yet.
Test: drawing routes works in prep.

Step 5 — Movement mechanics
Move offense along routes.
No defense yet.
Test: offense follows routes smoothly.

Step 6 — Ball / throwing (keyboard + click)
Implement attemptThrow, ballFlight, and keyboard 1–5.
Add click/hold on receiver list for bullet/lob.
Test: bullet throws and lobs both work every time.

Step 7 — Defense AI + tackling
Add defender chase logic and tackle detection.
Test: defenders move to ball, tackles end play.

Step 8 — Interception line checks
Add interception logic for bullets.
Test: bullet picked if defender on line; lob clears.

Step 9 — Polishing + HUD states
Add “GO/PREP” states, reset, and optional debug text.

Future Vision — Playbook Platform (not yet implemented)
- Build an NFL-style playbook site where users draw plays, simulate outcomes, and track stats.
- Allow per-player speed adjustments to model real-time scenarios.
- Add a structured play library and analytics dashboard.
